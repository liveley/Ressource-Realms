# Catan Setup Phase Implementation - Complete Guide

## Overview
This implementation adds full setup phase support to the Catan board game, enforcing all official rules for the initial settlement and road placement phases.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Turn Controller (turnController.js)
**Added:**
- Setup phase constants: `SETUP_SETTLEMENT_1`, `SETUP_ROAD_1`, `SETUP_SETTLEMENT_2`, `SETUP_ROAD_2`
- Setup state tracking: current round, player order, completion status
- Phase transition logic for setup phases
- Player order reversal for second round
- Automatic transition to regular play after setup completion

**Key Functions:**
- `isInSetupPhase()` - Check if currently in setup phase
- `getSetupProgress()` - Get current setup progress
- `recordSetupAction(actionType)` - Record and advance setup phase
- `resetToStart()` - Initialize game in setup phase

### 2. Build Logic (buildLogic.js)
**Added:**
- `isValidSetupSettlementPlacement()` - Setup-specific settlement validation
- `isValidSetupRoadPlacement()` - Setup-specific road validation
- `tryBuildSetupSettlement()` - Build settlement in setup phase
- `tryBuildSetupRoad()` - Build road in setup phase
- Initial resource distribution for second settlement
- Setup-specific connectivity rules

**Key Rules Implemented:**
- First settlement: Distance rule only (no road requirement)
- First road: Must connect to player's most recent settlement
- Second settlement: Distance rule only (no road requirement)
- Second road: Must connect to player's most recent settlement
- Second settlement gives initial resources from adjacent tiles
- No resource cost for setup buildings

### 3. Build Event Handlers (buildEventHandlers.js)
**Added:**
- Setup phase detection in click handlers
- Automatic use of setup build functions during setup
- Phase advancement after successful setup builds
- City building restriction during setup

**Integration:**
- Detects current phase and calls appropriate build functions
- Records setup actions to advance phases
- Provides proper feedback for invalid actions

### 4. Build UI (uiBuild.js)
**Added:**
- Setup phase awareness in build menus
- Dynamic button enabling/disabling based on current phase
- Visual feedback for unavailable actions
- Context-sensitive button tooltips

**Features:**
- Settlement button enabled only during settlement phases
- Road button enabled only during road phases
- City button disabled during entire setup phase
- Clear visual indicators for available actions

### 5. Build Preview (uiBuildPreview.js)
**Added:**
- Setup-specific validation for preview meshes
- Correct rule application based on current phase
- No preview for invalid actions during setup

**Behavior:**
- Shows valid placement previews using setup rules
- Hides previews for invalid placements
- Uses correct validation functions per phase

## Setup Phase Flow

### Phase Sequence:
1. **SETUP_SETTLEMENT_1** - Each player places first settlement (order: 1,2,3,4)
2. **SETUP_ROAD_1** - Each player places first road (order: 1,2,3,4)
3. **SETUP_SETTLEMENT_2** - Each player places second settlement (order: 4,3,2,1)
4. **SETUP_ROAD_2** - Each player places second road (order: 4,3,2,1)
5. **REGULAR_PLAY** - Game continues with normal rules

### Turn Order:
- **Round 1**: Players take turns in normal order (1→2→3→4)
- **Round 2**: Players take turns in reverse order (4→3→2→1)
- **Transition**: After setup, game starts with player 1 in dice phase

## Rule Enforcement

### Settlement Rules (Setup):
- ✅ Must be at least 2 edges away from any existing settlement
- ✅ Must be on a land tile corner (not pure water)
- ✅ No road connectivity required
- ✅ No resource cost
- ✅ Second settlement gives initial resources

### Road Rules (Setup):
- ✅ Must connect to player's most recent settlement
- ✅ Must be on a land tile edge (not pure water)
- ✅ Cannot overlap existing roads
- ✅ No resource cost
- ✅ No general connectivity requirement

### Phase Advancement:
- ✅ Automatic phase progression after each valid build
- ✅ Automatic player switching at appropriate times
- ✅ Proper turn order reversal for second round
- ✅ Smooth transition to regular play

## Testing

### Manual Testing:
- Load `demo_setup.html` to see setup phase in action
- Use build menu to place settlements and roads
- Observe automatic phase progression
- Check rule enforcement for invalid placements

### Automated Testing:
- Run `test_setup.html` for comprehensive test suite
- Tests cover phase progression, rule validation, and edge cases
- Validates all setup-specific logic

## Usage

### Starting a Game:
```javascript
// Game automatically starts in setup phase
resetToStart(); // If manual reset needed
```

### Checking Phase:
```javascript
import { getCurrentPhase, isInSetupPhase } from './modules/turnController.js';

if (isInSetupPhase()) {
    // Use setup-specific logic
}
```

### Building in Setup:
```javascript
// The build event handlers automatically detect setup phase
// and use the appropriate build functions
```

## Files Modified

1. **turnController.js** - Core setup phase logic
2. **buildLogic.js** - Setup-specific build functions
3. **buildEventHandlers.js** - Integration with UI
4. **uiBuild.js** - UI awareness of setup phases
5. **uiBuildPreview.js** - Preview system integration
6. **main.js** - Game initialization

## Files Added

1. **test_setup_phases.js** - Automated test suite
2. **test_setup.html** - Test runner page
3. **demo_setup.html** - Interactive demo
4. **SETUP_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - This documentation

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
- [ ] Harbor placement preview during setup
- [ ] Undo functionality for setup phase
- [ ] Setup phase tutorial/guided mode
- [ ] AI opponent setup behavior
- [ ] Custom setup variants (balanced, random, etc.)

### Code Quality:
- [ ] Additional unit tests for edge cases
- [ ] Performance optimization for large multiplayer games
- [ ] Better error handling and recovery
- [ ] Accessibility improvements for UI elements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Game doesn't start in setup phase**: Check that `resetToStart()` is called in main.js
2. **Build buttons not updating**: Verify phase change listeners are properly registered
3. **Invalid placements allowed**: Check that setup validation functions are being called
4. **Phase not advancing**: Ensure `recordSetupAction()` is called after successful builds

### Debug Tools:
- Open browser console for detailed logging
- Use `window.showGameStatus()` in demo page
- Check `getSetupProgress()` for current state
- Verify phase with `getCurrentPhase()`

This implementation provides a complete, rule-compliant setup phase for the Catan board game, ready for production use.
